# Odin Kittens

This small application was developed to experiment with using APIs. It corresponds to the first project in the ["Project: APIs" page](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/apis) of The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails course.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
